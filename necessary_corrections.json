These are optional, for now, use them for power input, item input, and item output. Tier does not affect item transfer, so use the cheapest ones for that.\n\nLet's build a 5x5x5 room. Expanding it vertically is easy to do, or you can make it wider and longer, as long as both X and Z match and are odd. Up to 5% of the plascrete blocks can be replaced with Reinforced Glass to see into the cleanroom and check on machines.\n\nYou can pass materials through the walls using Machine Hulls. You can pass 1A of power using a Machine Hull as well, or you can use Diodes to pass multiple amps through.\n\nJust be really careful when upgrading your machines. Be sure to remove the machine hulls and diodes and replace them with the new power tier, or else you will be very sad. You don't need to do this for ones you only use to pass items through.\n\nIf the Cleanroom has maintenance issues, it will have a chance to void recipes needing a cleanroom (10% per maint issue!). Monitor your cleanroom with a Hand Scanner, Industrial Information Panel, or using a Needs Maintenance Cover and a Redstone Powered Light or Howler Alarm.\n\nAdditionally, the longer the door is open, the lower the efficiency will get, which has a direct correlation to recipe voiding. So open the door as little as possible! There are ways around this though, for example, with an elevator or travel anchor, you never actually need to open the door!\n\n§3Multiblocks such as the LCR, LPF, or PA count as cleanrooms, so you don't need to put them in one. You cannot use the bio lab in a PA, so you'll still need the cleanroom later on.\n\nOther helpful hints include: generating power inside the cleanroom, using a wireless connector for AE or a transvector interface to skip machine hulls, and that you can use higher tier energy hatches to reach 100% efficiency faster (does not use more power once at 100%).",

One input will turn the machine on, and one input will turn the machine off. Use a comparator attached to a valve to measure the steam level in your multiblock Iron or Steel Tank. Invert the signal to turn on your boiler when the steam level is low. When the steam level signal is high, turn your boiler off. Use a trail of redstone to lower the signal strength. Because of boiler/turbine warmup, try to set the ON strength to 30 percent of capacity and OFF strength to about 90 percent.\n\nRed alloy wire will hold a redstone signal for a longer distance than normal redstone, while redstone conduits will go indefinitely. You can also use amplified redcrystal to improve the strength of the signal for a long distance, repeating as necessary. \n\nYou can use a Energy Detector Cover in Normal Electrical Storage (including batteries) mode to monitor the power in a battery buffer and use it to enable/disable generators in a similar way. Change mode using a screwdriver. If you use a dense redcrystal, it will only allow signal through at a certain level, perfect for automating this kind of thing.\n\nYou can use MCCs on more than just generators though, you can use it on any multiblock (and most SBs too). This is useful to prevent voiding of materials. If a non-GT++ multi is full, it'll void the items or liquid (GT++ ones will halt) and keep on truckin', potentially voiding huge amounts of materials. You'll want to use them in combination with Fluid or Item Detection Covers on the output hatch or bus.\n\n§2If you still don't get it, watch moron's video on it at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPfnifJEO64",

Pollution is nobody's friend!\n\nDuring setup, make sure the center of the EBF is hollow. Sometimes things can sneak in there without you noticing, like a Thaumcraft light orb!\n\nMake sure your muffler faces §lout§r, not §lin§r. The EBF can't work if it is not spreading those delightful odors!\n\nWhen placing your power hatches, make sure to minimize the distance between any generators and the EBF. Especially at LV, those few blocks make a big difference! Every amp of energy travelling over a cable loses a little bit - and you'll need as much as you can get! Your best setup is to put two generators right next to each hatch, with a 2A cable. If you're poor, you could use 2 battery buffers with 2 batteries each directly attached to each hatch. Make sure to top off the buffers' generators. If you make 9 slot battery buffers, you can fill them up over time to get longer running time until you get stable power.\n\nOutput hatches and buses will automatically push into tanks and inventories placed next to them such as chests or BC tanks. They will also void if they're full, so keep an eye on them!\n\nWhen building multiple EBFs, the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace can share walls.

The QC will consume 1A of UV, and each CR will use one more. So another important factor is to ONLY turn on the Quantum Computer once you have the desired recipe for the Research Station ready to avoid excess energy loss. Remember to turn the QC on BEFORE the RS. In order for you to build this absolute monster, you'll need to place down the Quantum Computer at least 1 block above the surface/ground and use the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector to see where to place everything. The blocks with no dots next to the vents indicate that that space must be empty.\n\nUncertainty Resolver:\nMuch like a puzzle-solving simulation, it is rather complicated to explain how to solve it, but it's often best just to retrace or undo certain actions and hope for the best. Sometimes, the Schrödinger Status will require some puzzle solving again after a period of time. This is random and incredibly frustrating, especially during operations being done between the Research Station and Quantum Computer(s), so it is important to constantly check the Uncertainty Resolver before you start operations on your Computer. If the puzzle looks too hard or you can't complete it, just remove it and the controller and re-place them to get a different puzzle.\n\nComputer Racks:\nThe main component within the multiblock to generate Computation. In order to achieve this, you will need to input some circuits and ic2 heat vents; Advanced Heat Vents work best. It is critical that you use Heat Vents to prevent the heat from reaching a catastrophic point, 55 percent or above should be avoided for safety reasons. Technically, you could achieve above 55 percent heat capacity or 5500 heat capacity, however the Computer Racks may melt or explode above 5600 or 6000 heat. You can see this for individual Racks by scanning them. You cannot remove or input components until the heat is gone. You can see the overall heat value in the controller's interface. And most importantly: DO NOT WRENCH THE COMPUTER RACKS IF THEY HAVE HEAT IN THEM. Otherwise, you're going to get an explosion.\n\nComputation:\nComputation is generated every second and is based on the tier of your circuit. There are, however, differences in between how much computation is generated, even with the same exact tier. For instance, you could use a Master Quantum Computer (Quantum Circuit Series / LuV) or a Wetwareprocessor (Wetware Circuit Series / LuV) which will give you more Computation even though they are of the same tier. If you wish to find out exactly how much Computation a circuit gives; place down a Computer Rack, put a circuit inside and scan it. You can also see the total computation in the controller.\n\nIt will include the following information.\nBase computation: \nAfter overclocking: <numbers, same as above unless you specially overclock it>\nHeat Accumulated: <numbers, based on circuits and heat vents, keep a watchful eye on this part as it's extremely important>\n\nUsing the Parametrizer you can overclock and overvolt, but you never need to, so you may or may not wish to try it.\n\nSending Computation to the Research Station:\nUse the Optical Master Connector in one of the variable spaces on the QC, and the Optical Slave Connector on the RS. Use Optical Fiber Cable to connect them, and make sure to paint all three.\n\nSuggested Build:\nNow that you've understood the concepts and safety of handling of the QC, what are the more optimal setups for your Quantum Computer? For now, I'll suggest 2 racks with 3 Ultimate Crystalcomputers each, and of course 1 Advanced Heat Vent. Do keep in mind that this 156 C/s setup can complete practically 3/4s of the recipes in the Research Station. This is a rather minimal setup compared to some of the more complicated setups.\n\nNow that you understand the QC, it's time to build it! You'll need to gather quite a lot of resources.",

The Research Station requires you to put the item to research within the Object Holder, then a data stick in the Multiblock interface. Once the Computation is fully completed, the data stick that houses all the data of the completed item will be inside the Multiblock Interface.\n\nStill confused? Good, that's the spirit of learning!

		"eng_desc": "For those new to GregTech, here are some tips and warnings about electricity. \n\nMachines don't like being out in the rain, and will start fires nearby.  Fires next to a machine have a random chance of an explosion. Also, sending a higher voltage than a machine's tier cause an explosion. Or several, if you pack things together, like many people. Sending more amps than a machine can use doesn't harm anything though.\n\nSending too high a voltage or too many amps down a cable will cause the cable to burn up and start fires, which may then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number of amps provided by generators and buffers to a wire does not exceed the amps it is capable of carrying.\n\nA generator that supplys 1A can possibly feed multiple machines, if their recipes require less than full voltage.  For example, macerators doing ore only need 2 EU/t, so you could run several off of a single 1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too long. Why? Becuase there's loss for every amp for every block, listed on the wire/cable. Note that cables are batter than wires. But be careful! Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect, like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.\n\nMost machines only use 1A, however there are exceptions, such as the arc furnace, thermal centrifuge, world accelerators, and the UUM machines. Note that machines can accept more amps than they use (usually 2) in order to top up their energy supply, especially if they didn't recieve most of the amp because of loss (mostly a problem in LV). The formula is (EU/t of Recipe * 2) / Voltage Tier) + 1. Keep this in mind when deciding cables.\n\nSome machines are specifically for dealing with multiple amps, such as battery buffers, transformers, and diodes.\n\nIf you want to send more amps, use a larger cable or a superconductor (MV+). You can use the laser hatches much later to send even more.\n\nA single block machine starved of EU will restart progress but not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will lose the items.\n\nNote that any block that emits UE has loss when doing so: 2 ^ tier. So 2 EU at LV, 4 EU at MV, and so on. Using large numbers of battery buffers in a row is thus very wasteful of your power, and even 1 can prevent usage of an EBF at MV voltage. Of course, if you want to keep your amps topped up, you'll need to place BBs occasionally to 'top up' the amps, though this is less the case the further ingame you get, as the loss becomes less of something to worry about.\n\nIf this info isn't enough for you, head on over to https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Electricity to read more.",

		"eng_name": "Moron's Guide to Breeding Better Bees",
		"eng_desc": "First off, don't be scared by the massive amounts of bees you see here once you unlock the breeding trees. There's even more that aren't included and you'll need NEI to find!\n\nHa ha, just kidding - don't panic! Once you unlock the bee breeding lines, look around and pick and choose which bees really interest you. The way the breeding is done is mostly left to right, and top down. Some of the lines at the bottom might look simple, but they will require bees further up to complete first. Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options, only one is shown here.\n\nBees have two sets of traits, one that is §aActive§r that has effects on how the bee lives, and one §3Inactive§r but can be used for breeding. Some traits are §4Dominant§r, and some are §9Recessive§r. Keep this in mind when trying to breed in or out a new trait. When getting newly bred princesses and drones, check both sets in case you got the targeted bee traits. You can breed the bees with inactive traits to try and make them active in later crosses. You can't see the passive traits using a Field Kit, you'll need a Beealyzer. For lots of bees, you can scan them first using a GT scanner, but you'll still need a Beealyzer to see passive traits.\n\nWhen breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon a master template bee.  A bee that has little or no crossbreeding potential, but has all the traits you prefer - short life, nocturnal, cave dwelling, rain tolerant, humidity tolerance, temperature tolerance, 4xfertility, etc.  Once you have that bee, breed a bunch of pure princesses with those traits as both active and inactive. These will be your breeding stock.\n\nWhen you are trying for a new bee, what you are wanting is a drone - this way you can use your \"breeding stock\" princess for easy breeding, but the drone to get the new species without the annoying effects or limitations. Poor crossed princesses can be returned to normal by crossing with breeding stock drones, or just thrown into storage if they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you keep the trait and species you want, and slowly merge the good traits from your breeding stock. You don't have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee House to swap around traits. Remember that no species mutations occur in a Bee House. Ignoble bees are good for this, since they're mostly disposable - they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles, increasing slightly more each generation after that, though genetic stability frames can let them live longer. Once you solidify your species, create a pool of drones. You can use those to convert pristine princesses to the new species. Pristine princesses will not die (they can become ignoble under certain circumstances though, like using tons of production frames). Rocky bees are a great source - all their princesses are always pristine, they have decent traits already, and there's a bunch of them underground. If you have an ender quarry, you can collect them with that.\n\nOnce you get a new species, it will replace all of one of the two sets of traits of the bee. §3If you get the mutation chance success twice on the same bee, it'll replace both active and inactive sets of traits though.§r For example when you get a Cultivated, either the Active or Inactive column will have all the default Cultivated traits. Mix it a few times and you'll eventually get purebred versions. Just watch out that you don't lose a key trait, like Fast Worker for Cultivated! All the quests will require §6purebred§r species. PS: most effects are useless, so don't worry too much.\n\nAll traits can be bred into any bee species, aside from the species itself. Species also determines the preferred temperature and humidity, as well as drops. Species will require their preferred temerature and humidity to be in 'jubilant' state, and produce their special drops. You can also mimic this with the alveary or industrial apiary, but NOT with tolerances.\n\nAdvanced frames can provide useful boosts to mutation chances, or to lifespan reduction for faster breeding cycles. However excessive multipliers will increase genetic decay, giving a chance for that pristine princess to become ignoble!\n\nIt looks complex, because it is! But it also a lot of dangerous and useful fun!",

The pylons need to indicate the X, Y and Z dimensions, with you needing 1 more than you would think. If the efficiency goes below 100%, the AE cost will balloon enormously, so add more pylons to counteract that. After using a redstone signal to activate the SIOP, the blocks will be moved to the spatial IO dim, and the drive will move to the output, so you can send it somewhere else. This is very important to do properly if you want to use it as a teleporter. Otherwise you can get stuck there. Your network will need to be able to hold all the power needed to teleport at once, so you'll need at least one energy cell. You can only have one Pylon setup per controller, so consider putting them on a subnetwork.\n\nUsing 2 in the X and Z dimensions and 3 in the Y will give you a 1x2x1 teleporter to teleport yourself. You'll want a SIOP port on each side for sending and for receiving. But you'll still need to design a redstone contraption to activate them properly!  \n\nRead this if you want to know more about spatial IO in general, and larger setups: https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/3c2b2r/a_treatise_on_nocheat_smp_ae2_spatial_io/\nAlso see this if you want to see a fancy teleporter: https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/2mhrf8/ae2_spatial_transporters/\n\n§4Spatial cells, once used, will only work in the XYZ dimensions first used, with no way to format or recraft.

		"eng_desc": "There's seven more stats to worry about too.\n\n§7Fertilizer§r, §9Water§r, and §4Weed-EX§r are all about how much of these is on the crop stick rather than the crop itself. They're all about how much was applied, and is left of that.\n\n§2Nutrients§r, §1Humidity§r, and §6Air Quality§r are all about the environment. They're also affected by the Fertilizer and Water stats.\n\nNutrients and Humidity are mostly about the right biome, with swamp and rainforest types (hot+humid) being the best, but you can also get some extra stats by setting up right.\n\n§2Nutrients§r:\n3 possible free points from dirt under the farmland block, 2 for plants that require a specific block. So optimally always make sure that the required block is at the bottommost bottom in the column, because it checks in chain, not certain height. For example: cropstick -> farmland -> dirt -> oreblock -> dirt, it will only register 1 dirt, ignoring the one below the oreblock.\n\n5-10 possible points from fertilizing your crops. You can use fertilizer on a crop to increase its nutrients stat. Fertilizer caps at 199 which gives 10 nutrients, but can be applied again only if the crop drops below 100 fertilizer points. So for high stat crops its safe to assume and make tests for 100 fertilizer points as its a given constant unlike 199->100 values. You can apply bonemeal, IC2 fertilizer and Forestry fertilizer to a crop by hand. Forestry manual orchard multifarm and crop matron does this automatically when supplied with fertilizer (the multifarm needs fertilizer to harvest crops as well).\n\n§1Humidity§r:\n2 free points from using dirt as farmland, as when farmland gets hydrated by water(turns darker) it gains 2 humidity points. This is why other blocks for this suck, since they don't give this bonus.\n\n10 possible points from hydrating your crop. Similiar to fertilizing, water can be applied to crop up to 200 points, which is 10 humidity points, altough unlike fertilizer it does not need to drop below value of 100, water can be applied over and over keeping it at constant 200 points. You can apply water to your crop by using IC2 hydration cells by hand, or let your Forestry manual orchard multifarm and crop matron do it automatically. The multifarm needs water to harvest crops as well though.\n\n§6Air Quality§r:\n4 potential free points from empty space around crop. A crop checks for empty spaces to calculate bonus air quality points, it gives up to 4 points, 1 point for each 2 empty spaces. It only counts full blocks or cropsticks though. If you like looks, you'll probably have to sacrifice this.\n\n4 free points from height of your farm. You get 1 free point every 15 blocks startng at Y79.\n79 - 1 point\n94 - 2 points\n109 - 3 points\n124 - 4 points\n\n2 free points from no opaque blocks above the crop. You can place glass above and you won't lose the bonus since it's a transparent block. You cannot use dark glass, several layers of water, or gaseous tenebrae to get around this if your crop likes the dark. Unless you only let it grow at night I guess§..\n\n§aGrowability§r:\nYour crop will require a certain level of NHA, try to reach or surpass this, or the crop will either not grow, or even die (disappear). Each crop is different, and higher tiers (and stats) require more. It's generally easy to meet though, as long as you're in a good biome.\n\nGrowability is determined by the difference between what the crop needs in terms of NHA, and what it actually has. If you have more than what you need it grows faster. This is why you don't want a maxed resistance stat, since higher stats will slow it down.",

Crossbreeding with the ones you got on the way to raise their stats is also good.\n\nSetup camp in a swamp/jungle type biome around Y130, or use the biome changing methods to make one. This is way faster when breeding crops, not just growing them for drops.\n\nUse multifarms, always. You can use them together with the harvesters if you have super fast crops. Or just use more farms. Or add more gearboxes.\n\nDark glass is nice for oreberry crops.\n\nTo avoid weeding, checkerboard up and down on your multifarm. It may look stupid, but no weeds, Gr 23->31, and +2 AQ!\n\nUse fertilia to create more fertilizer.\n\nYou can replace mob farms with crops if you don't care about the other drops. Infernals drop special stuff though.\n\nUse WAs in TE mode to accelerate crops if you need it. Mostly useful for breeding, statting up, and for the primordial berry crop.\n\nAs you tier up, you can create 31/31/0 crops with the machines and UUM.

For covers that you can adjust the amount of, clicking the left side with a screwdriver goes down, and right goes up. All covers block rain on the side they're attached to. Generally you can adjust covers with a screwdriver, whether they have a GUI or not. You can remove them with a crowbar if you forgot.\n\n§9§lFluid-Related Covers:§r\nPump: Transfers fluids at the speed specified on the tooltip.\n\nFluid Regulator: Regulates the rate that fluid can go through it, as well as pumping it. Can work x/s or x/t.\n\nSteam Valve: Moves more, but is only for steam. Only goes to IV. Does not work on SH steam.\n\nOverflow: GT++, will be removed soon? Voids anything over the specified amount in the tank.\n\nFluid Detector: Will emit RS based on fluid fill rate of the tank it's on. By default, empty=15, full=0. Use inverted mode to swap. Useful on tanks and hatches.\n\nEnder Fluid Link: Cover version of ender tanks to TP fluid around. Doesn't connect to ender tanks though.\n\nDrain Module: Protects from rain on that side, and will fill the tank with water from rain if it can. Useless.\n\nFluid Filter: Filters fluid going through it. Click with a cell to set it.\n\nShutter: Blocks items/fluids when active. Use it with a machine controller and RS. Does not visually disconnect/block. You place it between the pipes, and put the MC on the same pipe.\n\n§2§lItem-Related Covers:§r\nConveyor: Sends items. Use an item pipe in import mode or on a GT block/machine.\n\nRobot Arm: Sends from a specific slot in the machine it's on (internal) to another specific slot in a block next to it (adjacent). Keep going through numbers until you get it right, it seems to change per machine. If the output slot is full, it won't output. There need to be a valid block with slots to send to or the settings won't save.\n\nItem Detector: Will emit RS based on item fill rate of the block it's on. By default, empty=0, full=15. Detects by filled slots, so doesn't work right with the super/quantum chests. Probably better for busses.\n\nItem Filter: WIP PR.\n\n§6§lEU-Related Covers:§r\nEnergy Detector: Will emit RS based on EU fill rate of the batbuff/tank it's on. By default, empty=0, full=15. Make sure to set it to include batteries. Can also detect steam for some reason.\n\nPower Pass Upgrade: Read the tooltip, then ask Bart how it works, he didn't bother telling anyone. He'll probably just tell you the code is the best documentation, just like the Tectech guys. May not actually be finished/work, either.\n\nTesla Coil/Tesla Coil Rich Edition: Use with the tesla tower to send EU wirelessly or something. \n\n§d§lOther Covers:§r\nPlayer Detector: Detects players. About 10 block range. §4Currently owner/other is inverted on non-pipes due to some bug or another.§r\n\nActivity Detector: Detects either recipe progress or idleness. 0%=0 RS, ~95%=14 by default. In idle mode, idleness is 15, and is 0 when running by default.\n\nMachine Controller: Turns machine on/off based on RS. Disable machine will keep it off regardless of RS state. Safe Mode only works on MBs. If a MB runs out of power, it will normally turn off, but a MC will turn it back on, continuing to void stuff. This will set it to the disable machine state instead. You will also get a notification. §4Safe mode is currently broken?§r\n\nNeeds Maintenance: Emits RS if it meets the condition specified. Rotor=turbine?\n\nRedstone Transmitter/Receiver (In/Out): OK, these things are confusing, so listen closely. First, set a frequency, either by using the GUI, or using the original way: right clicking it with an item. Empty hand = 0, other items = their item ID. Be careful not to reset it to 0 by accident. Honestly, just use the GUI. You can set it to private or not, it's the same kind of thing as EnderStorage, so you don't blare RS across the server. Channel state = RS level.\n\nRT(O) sets the channel state based on the redstone level sent from outside to the specific side. You can TP a RS from this to the RR(O).\nRT(I) sets the channel state based on redstone level that would be emitted from the machine itself. §4Always sends 15, so it's useless.§r\nRR(O) outputs redstone level based on channel state. You can TP RS from the RT(O) to here.\nRR(I) controls whether a machine can work based on channel state, just like a machine controller cover does. If it has 0 RS, it stays off. At least 1, and it turns on. You send the signal from elsewhere with the RT(O).\nRR(I) can also be used in conjunction with other covers whose states talk about conditional.\n\nIC2 Heat vents: Speeds up machines a tiny amount?

For covers that you can adjust the amount of, clicking the left side with a screwdriver goes down, and right goes up. All covers block rain on the side they're attached to. Generally you can adjust covers with a screwdriver, whether they have a GUI or not. You can remove them with a crowbar if you forgot.\n\n§9§lFluid-Related Covers:§r\nPump: Transfers fluids at the speed specified on the tooltip.\n\nFluid Regulator: Regulates the rate that fluid can go through it, as well as pumping it. Can work x/s or x/t.\n\nSteam Valve: Moves more, but is only for steam. Only goes to IV. Does not work on SH steam.\n\nOverflow: Voids anything over the specified amount in the tank.\n\nFluid Detector: Will emit RS based on fluid fill rate of the tank it's on. By default, empty=15, full=0. Use inverted mode to swap. Useful on tanks and hatches.\n\nEnder Fluid Link: Cover version of ender tanks to TP fluid around. Doesn't connect to ender tanks though.\n\nDrain Module: Protects from rain on that side, and will fill the tank with water from rain if it can. Useless.\n\nFluid Filter: Filters fluid going through it. Click with a cell to set it.\n\nShutter: Blocks items/fluids when active. Use it with a machine controller and RS. Does not visually disconnect/block. You place it between the pipes, and put the MC on the same pipe.\n\n§2§lItem-Related Covers:§r\nConveyor: Sends items. Use an item pipe in import mode or on a GT block/machine.\n\nRobot Arm: Sends from a specific slot in the machine it's on (internal) to another specific slot in a block next to it (adjacent). Keep going through numbers until you get it right, it seems to change per machine. If the output slot is full, it won't output. There need to be a valid block with slots to send to or the settings won't save.\n\nItem Detector: Will emit RS based on item fill rate of the block it's on. By default, empty=0, full=15. Detects by filled slots, so doesn't work right with the super/quantum chests. Probably better for busses.\n\nItem Filter: WIP PR.\n\n§6§lEU-Related Covers:§r\nEnergy Detector: Will emit RS based on EU fill rate of the batbuff/tank it's on. By default, empty=0, full=15. Make sure to set it to include batteries. Can also detect steam for some reason.\n\nPower Pass Upgrade: Read the tooltip, then ask Bart how it works, he didn't bother telling anyone. He'll probably just tell you the code is the best documentation, just like the Tectech guys. May not actually be finished/work, either.\n\nTesla Coil/Tesla Coil Rich Edition: Use with the tesla tower to send EU wirelessly or something. \n\n§d§lOther Covers:§r\nPlayer Detector: Detects players. About 10 block range. §4Currently owner/other is inverted on non-pipes due to some bug or another.§r\n\nActivity Detector: Detects either recipe progress or idleness. 0%=0 RS, ~95%=14 by default. In idle mode, idleness is 15, and is 0 when running by default.\n\nMachine Controller: Turns machine on/off based on RS. Disable machine will keep it off regardless of RS state. Safe Mode only works on MBs. If a MB runs out of power, it will normally turn off, but a MC will turn it back on, continuing to void stuff. This will set it to the disable machine state instead. You will also get a notification. §4Safe mode is currently broken?§r\n\nNeeds Maintenance: Emits RS if it meets the condition specified. Rotor=turbine?\n\nRedstone Transmitter/Receiver (In/Out): OK, these things are confusing, so listen closely. First, set a frequency, either by using the GUI, or using the original way: right clicking it with an item. Empty hand = 0, other items = their item ID. Be careful not to reset it to 0 by accident. Honestly, just use the GUI. You can set it to private or not, it's the same kind of thing as EnderStorage, so you don't blare RS across the server. Channel state = RS level.\n\nRT(O) sets the channel state based on the redstone level sent from outside to the specific side. You can TP a RS from this to the RR(O).\nRT(I) sets the channel state based on redstone level that would be emitted from the machine itself. §4Always sends 15, so it's useless.§r\nRR(O) outputs redstone level based on channel state. You can TP RS from the RT(O) to here.\nRR(I) controls whether a machine can work based on channel state, just like a machine controller cover does. If it has 0 RS, it stays off. At least 1, and it turns on. You send the signal from elsewhere with the RT(O).\nRR(I) can also be used in conjunction with other covers whose states talk about conditional.\n\nIC2 Heat vents: Speeds up machines a tiny amount? Someone look through the code and tell me what it means. Also looks neat.\n\nCrafting Table: Adds a crafting table to the block you can use. Useless.\n\nPlanks/Plates/Foils: Blocks I/O on that side.

		"ru_desc": "В этом квесте рассматриваются все прикрытия, на случай, если вы забыли или они не были упомянуты. Если у них есть свой собственный квест, посмотрите его, чтобы получить больше информации. Вы можете поместить их практически на любой блок GT, трубу, машину, танк и т.д. Хотя это не учитывает, будет ли он работать правильно или будет ли он полезен. Shift-Right-Click откроет GUI для многих из них. Для крышек, количество которых можно регулировать, щелчок отверткой по левой стороне уменьшает, а по правой - увеличивает. Все крышки блокируют дождь на той стороне, к которой они прикреплены. Как правило, крышки можно регулировать отверткой, независимо от того, есть ли у них графический интерфейс или нет. Вы можете снять их ломом, если забыли.\n\nКрышки, связанные с жидкостями:§r\nНасос: Перекачивает жидкость со скоростью, указанной в подсказке.\n\nРегулятор жидкости: Регулирует скорость прохождения жидкости через него, а также перекачивает ее. Может работать х/с или х/т.\n\nПаровой клапан: Перемещает больше, но предназначен только для пара. Работает только на IV. Не работает на SH steam.\n\nOverflow: GT++, скоро будет удален? Уничтожает все, что превышает указанное количество в баке.\n\nFluid Detector: Излучает RS в зависимости от степени заполнения бака жидкостью. По умолчанию, пустой = 15, полный = 0. Используйте инвертированный режим для переключения. Полезен на танках и люках.\n\nEnder Fluid Link: Версия крышки эндер-танков для перемещения жидкости. Не соединяется с резервуарами эндера.\n\nDrain Module: Защищает от дождя с этой стороны, и наполняет резервуар водой от дождя, если может. Бесполезен.\n\nФильтр жидкости: Фильтрует жидкость, проходящую через него. Нажмите на ячейку, чтобы установить его.\n\nShutter: Блокирует предметы/жидкости, когда активен. Используйте его с контроллером машины и RS. Визуально не отсоединяет/блокирует. Вы помещаете его между трубами, а MC ставите на ту же трубу.\n\nКрышки, связанные с предметами:§r\nКонвейер: Отправляет предметы. Используйте трубу для предметов в режиме импорта или на блоке/машине GT.\n\nRobot Arm: отправляет предметы из определенного слота в машине, на которой он находится (внутренний), в другой определенный слот в блоке рядом с ним (смежный). Продолжайте перебирать номера, пока не добьетесь нужного результата. Если выходной слот заполнен, он не будет выводиться. Должен быть действующий блок со слотами для отправки, иначе настройки не сохранятся.\n\nItem Detector: Излучает RS, основываясь на степени заполнения элементами блока, на котором он находится. По умолчанию, пустой=0, полный=15. Определяет по заполненным слотам, поэтому не работает с супер/квантовыми сундуками. Возможно, лучше для автобусов.\n\nItem Filter: WIP PR.\n\nEU-Related Covers:§r\nEnergy Detector: Будет излучать RS в зависимости от EU наполнения батбаффа/бака, на котором он находится. По умолчанию, пустой=0, полный=15. Убедитесь, что он включает батареи. Может также определять пар по некоторым причинам.\n\nPower Pass Upgrade: Прочитайте подсказку, затем спросите Барта, как это работает, он не потрудился никому рассказать. Он, вероятно, просто скажет вам, что код - это лучшая документация, как и парни из Tectech. Может быть, на самом деле он тоже не закончил/работает.\n\nTesla Coil/Tesla Coil Rich Edition: Используется с башней Тесла для беспроводной передачи ЕС или чего-то подобного. \n\n§d§lДругие предметы:§r\nДетектор игроков: Обнаруживает игроков. Радиус действия около 10 блоков. §4В настоящее время владелец/другой инвертирован на не-трубах из-за какой-то ошибки или чего-то еще.§r\n\nДетектор активности: Определяет либо прогресс рецепта, либо безделье. 0%=0 RS, ~95%=14 по умолчанию. В режиме простоя, безделье равно 15, а при работе по умолчанию равно 0.\n\nМашинный контроллер: Включает/выключает машину на основе RS. Отключение машины будет держать ее выключенной независимо от состояния РС. Безопасный режим работает только на МБ. Если у MB закончится энергия, он выключится, но MC включит его снова, продолжая аннулировать данные. Вместо этого он перейдет в состояние отключенной машины. Вы также получите уведомление. §4На данный момент безопасный режим нарушен?§r\n\nНеобходимо обслуживание: Выдает RS, если выполняется указанное условие. Ротор=турбина?\n\nRedstone Transmitter/Receiver (In/Out): Хорошо, эти вещи запутаны, поэтому слушайте внимательно. Во-первых, установите частоту, либо с помощью GUI, либо оригинальным способом: щелкнув правой кнопкой мыши по элементу. Пустая рука = 0, другие предметы = их ID предмета. Будьте осторожны, чтобы случайно не сбросить его на 0. Честно говоря, просто используйте GUI. Вы можете установить его приватным или нет, это то же самое, что и EnderStorage, так что вы не разнесете RS по всему серверу. Состояние канала = уровень RS.\n\nRT(O) устанавливает состояние канала на основе уровня редстоуна, посылаемого извне на определенную сторону. Из него можно посылать RS на RR(O).\n\nRT(I) устанавливает состояние канала на основе уровня редстоуна, который будет испускаться из самой машины. §4Всегда посылает 15, поэтому бесполезна.§r\nRR(O) выводит уровень красного камня, основанный на состоянии канала. Вы можете переключить RS с RT(O) сюда.\nRRR(I) контролирует, может ли машина работать, основываясь на состоянии канала, так же, как это делает крышка контроллера машины. Если у него 0 RS, он остается выключенным. Если хотя бы 1, он включается. Вы посылаете сигнал из другого места с помощью RT(O).\nRR(I) также может использоваться в сочетании с другими крышками, чьи состояния говорят об условном.\n\nIC2 Тепловые вентиляционные отверстия: Ускоряет машины на крошечную величину?  Также выглядит аккуратно.\n\nСтол для рукоделия: Добавляет стол для ремесла в блок, который можно использовать. Бесполезно.\n\nPlanks/Plates/Foils: Блокируют вход/выход с этой стороны. Используйте отвертку, чтобы установить разрешенные типы вещей. По умолчанию блокирует все. Сначала установите выход на другую сторону, чтобы не менять ее настройки. Вы наверняка случайно воспользуетесь этим хотя бы раз.\n\nКомпьютерный монитор: Добавляет визуальный вид. Бесполезно, но вроде как модно.\n\nЛинза: Только визуально. Бесполезно."

Размер по умолчанию является максимальной рабочей зоной.\n\n§r§9§rРасчет удаления загрязнений равен (по умолчанию) 30 * Люки глушителя * Эффект турбины * Эффект мультиблока * 2.5 ^ Эффективный уровень, где:\n\n- Люки глушителя - количество люков глушителя на мультиблоке (до 8)\n\n- Эффект турбины - эффективность турбины, выбранной для работы мультиблока. Она не будет работать, если в контроллере нет турбины.\n\n- Мультиблок Eff - эффективность мультиблока (100% при отсутствии проблем с обслуживанием, -10% при каждой проблеме)\n\n- Эффективный три - эффективный уровень: минимальный уровень между электрическим уровнем и уровнем глушителя\n\n§r Очистка загрязнения увеличивается на два (по умолчанию) при использовании абсорбционного фильтра. При добавлении во входную шину, он будет потребляться и использоваться в течение 30 (по умолчанию) успешных циклов очистки загрязнений. Если обрабатывается чанк, в котором нет загрязнений, это не считается успешным, и мехонизм решает, что в чанке нет загрязнений, если загрязнение ниже 10k gibbl (по умолчанию). После 30-го успешного цикла очистки загрязнений выходная шина выдаст сообщение 'Грязный абсорбционный фильтр / Dirty Absorption Filter'.\n\nЧтобы узнать, присутствует ли фильтр поглощения и сколько осталось циклов, используйте портативный сканер на контроллере.\n\n§9§rЦикл загрязнения длится 10 с, а очистка производится каждую секунду."
